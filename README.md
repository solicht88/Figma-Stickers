# Figma Stickers  

Inspired by acon's anime logo design workshop at Hack Club, I decided to work on my graphic design skills by making stickers through Figma!  
All stickers contained in this repository are original creations, but may be \(heavily\) inspired by my interests \(artists, media, etc.\)
